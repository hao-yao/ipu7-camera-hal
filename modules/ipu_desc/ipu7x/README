It's generated by auto tool in algo-release when build imaging-control.
We can get it with follow steps manually:

cd imaging-control && rm -fr build && mkdir build && cd build
AIQ_CMAKE="-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON \
           -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF \
           -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
           -DENABLE_IA_AIC=OFF \
           -DINSTALL_BINARIES=ON \
           -DHEADERS_INSTALL_DIRECTORY=include/ia_imaging \

           -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./install \
           -DIPU_VER=ipu7

cmake $AIQ_CMAKE ..

==============================================================================
All above header files must be prepared and copied to the build environment
before compiling HAL. And will do that in Makefile or build script
